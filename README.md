## SUMMARY:
 < I first created the function graph_Data to set up the turtles,window,and coordinates.Using the parameter, upperend_bound, I set the range from 1 to upperend_bound for the sequence function, gave the points for the graph. In addition, I set max_so_far to 0, and then used if else statement to determine if result is greater than max_so_far, max_so_far would assume that value.I then used this number for myturtle_writer to write the max iterations so far.>
